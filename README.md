# StateInCompose
This is a Codelab from the Compose essentials course for Android developers. It shows me "how the app's state determines what is displayed in the UI, how Compose updates the UI when state changes by working with different APIs, how to optimize the structure of our composable functions, and using ViewModels in a Compose world."

My results!
